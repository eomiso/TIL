# Basic Hardwares to Remember

__[Microcontroller(MCU)]__ \
Microcontrollers are `special purpose computers`. 
(consider your desktop as general purpose comuter) \
And the Microcontrollers have *RAM, ROM, EEPROM* embedded in it.
Based on Harvard architecture 
::: details Keywords
**embedded**(inside another device), **dedicated** (to one task),
 **small and lowcost**.

Q. What is the difference between microcontroller and processor?
imcrocontroller is implemented into a processor.\
:::


__[ROM]__ \
Permanently stores data on personal computers(PCs) and other electornic devices.
::: details Keywords 
**Read Only Memory**. \
Essential for basic input/output system **(BIOS)**
Starting the computer.\
**RAM** is volatile on the other hand.
:::


__[EEPROM]__ 
::: details Keywords 
Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory \
Also called(or the updated version EEPROM) is **Flash Memory**. 
:::


__[PIC]__ \
an example of popular microcontroller.


__[Processor]__ \
or known as **microprocessor**. No peripheral devices such as RAM, ROM,EEPROM. \
Therefore, it is bulkier than microcontrollers(*compact*). \
But faster(1 GHz) than MCU(8 MHz ~ 5MHz).\
MCU has **power saving system**, while Processor are not.\
Microcontrollers are based on Harvard Architecture<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup>\
, while Processors are based on Von Neumann model<sup>[2](#footnote2)</sup> where program and data are stored in same memory module.
